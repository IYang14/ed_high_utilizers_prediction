# ed_high_utilizers_prediction

This project focuses on predicting high utilizers of Emergency Department (ED) services by analyzing a claims dataset. Using SQL and Python, the data was explored and cleaned within a Jupyter notebook environment. The analysis includes the implementation of various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests (using the sklearn package), to identify the key factors contributing to increased ED visits. In addition to understanding the current high utilizers, the project also includes a prediction model to identify potential future high utilizers. The results are intended to help healthcare providers target groups for interventions that can reduce unnecessary ED visits and improve patient outcomes.
